## Administrative

### How should I get a grade?

You should be able to register for the seminar on the [<u>Uni Stuttgart CAMPUS system</u>](https://campus.uni-stuttgart.de). If this is not possible, we will be able to offer a Schein, on successful completion of the seminar.


### Is attendance mandatory? Can I join via Zoom?

Yes, attending the sessions is mandatory, particularly during the presentation talks. Even if you are not presenting, it is a must to attend all sessions. Skipping sessions without a valid reason or prior notification will lead to failing the seminar. Also, we do not allow a virtual participation.
