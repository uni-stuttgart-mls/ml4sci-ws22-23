<a href="https://kmario23.github.io" target="_blank">Mario</a> is a researcher at the [Machine Learning for Simulation Science](https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/departments/mls) lab at the University of Stuttgart, working with Prof. Mathias Niepert. His current focus is on developing novel as well as improving existing machine learning methods (mainly, DNNs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), and in a broader context, addressing challenging problems in Scientific Machine Learning and Geometric Deep Learning. All in all, he is super excited about Simulations and AI/ML4Science.
